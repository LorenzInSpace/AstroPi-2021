# AstroPi-2021
# Mission Space Lab code - LorenzInSpace team (Î³InSpace)

## About us
We are a team of high school students at the end of our schooling at _applied science lyceum_ [C. Lorenzini](http://istitutolorenzinipescia.edu.it/). We all are interested in math, physics and computer science.

## The project
Our project consisted in developing a neural network able to determine how much rain has fallen in one day on a specific region given only a picture.

## Important files
* [neuralNetwork.py](https://github.com/LorenzInSpace/AstroPi-2021/blob/main/neuralNetwork.py) : contains the actual neural network that does the magic
* [salvapioggia.js](https://github.com/LorenzInSpace/AstroPi-2021/blob/main/salvapioggia.js) : google earth engine script to recover precipitation data
* [utilityScript.py](https://github.com/LorenzInSpace/AstroPi-2021/blob/main/utilityScript.py) : collection of three python scripts we used to generate and modify csv and image files
