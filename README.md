# AstroPi-2021
# Mission Space Lab code - LorenzInSpace team (Î³InSpace)

## About us
We are a team of high school students at the end of our schooling at _applied science lyceum_ [C. Lorenzini](http://istitutolorenzinipescia.edu.it/). We all are interested in math, physics and computer science.

## The project
Our project consisted in developing a neural network able to determine how much rain has fallen in one day on a specific region given only a picture.

## Important files
* neuralNetwork.py : contains the actual neural network that does the magic
* salvapioggia.js : google earth engine script to recover precipitations data
